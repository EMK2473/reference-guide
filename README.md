# reference-guide
Reference Guide for Bootcamp; built from the ground up using HTML and CSS.

# What needs to be done:
## 1:
- Design CSS variables and schemes for scalability:
    - Decide on colors, font style, box designs, border styles, etc. (all the Stlying needs to be defined ahead of time and variables added to the root before developing the rest of the site)
- Choose CSS selectors and Attribute selectors to for scalability
 - define tooltip style and format
 - define image styling and hyperlink styling
- Decide on pseudo elements
 - (icons, images, special text)
- Decide on page format (spacing, borders, flex boxes, where images will go in, what will be a hyperlink, etc. )
## 2:

- Collect and organize all images intended to be used. Store in /assets/images/
 - Collect and organize all hyperlinks intended to be used. Store them in HTML or README for ease of access.
 
## 3:
- Design page layout, and add elements to CSS
- Add body, h1, p, a, div, etc. tags to HTML for format
- Design "term" layout and "definition" layout (consider using tooltips or pseudo elements).
- Decide and develop Hover, Active, and Focus pseudo elements.

## 4
- Decide on content to be used and defined in each section (i.e. what sequences and processes to include, what html tags to define, what css elements to define, *what part of each sections is worth including and will be most effective in a reference guide*)
- 

## 5
- Decide on media queries and how to implement them.

## 6
- We want clean, effecient code, that requires the least amount of work, clutter, and time spent, while being *efficient and scaleable*(scalability is the key to large, lucrative projects!). 
- Focus on proper sequencing to complete this project.
- Don't put this project ahead of anything for the bootcamp-- *this is meant to be a project to practice, and implement, what we learned from the bootcamp in a stress free environment.
- Use this oppurtunity to properly practice pushing and pulling from GitHub, using branches, working with others to solve problems, and general workflow expected once you're a part of the software workforce.
